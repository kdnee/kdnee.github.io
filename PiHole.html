            <p> What is Pi-Hole? To put it simply; it's an ad-blocker. You may have used an ad-blocker in your browser to avoid Youtube ads or ads elsewhere online, this ad-blocker typically works by filtering out specified lists and not displaying any content from said list. So these ads are still being loaded in the background and can still slow down your browsing experience. Pi-Hole on the other hand is a network-level ad-blocker that works by acting as a dedicated DNS Server with specified filter lists. That means instead of your device activity passing through the DNS set up by your ISP it gets sent to the Pi-Hole server, where it passes through the user-defined filter. This filter will block anything on the network’s Blocklist by returning an invalid DNS for all blocked traffic. Traffic that isn’t listed on the Blacklist gets pushed upstream to a public DNS server to be resolved.</p>
            <p> Pi-Hole was built to be run on a RasberryPi and its OS but Pi-Hole can run on several different Linux distributions. So that means it can be installed directly onto a raspberry pi or almost any other Linux machine. It also can run inside of Docker Container for an even smaller footprint. I chose to set up a virtual machine with Rasbian installed on my Proxmox server and installed Pi-Hole from the Git Repository.</p>
            <p>Once Pi-Hole is installed and configured with the proper network settings all that is left to do is point each device on the network to the Pi-Hole DNS server rather than the default DNS. The great part of using Pi-Hole is the ability to block things like trackers and telemetrics that are usually built into most websites, and even doing so with those pesky popups to turn off your ad-blocker as you get on many news sites. Pi-Hole makes it easy to import blacklists, whitelists, and even monitor traffic and edit lists on the fly all through it’s Web UI. </p>
